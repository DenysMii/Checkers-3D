Rules:

8x8 board and 24 checkers (12 white, 12 black).

White goes first.

When moving, the checker moves to an empty field diagonally by one cell and only forward.

If there is a checker of the opposite color in front of the checker, and the field behind it is free, then the checker can beat it.

You can also beat backwards, if possible.

If after beating it is possible to beat another checker, the player can do it.

It is obligatory to hit (not the opponent, but his checker).

After a checker reaches the opposite end of the board, it becomes a king.

The king can move any number of squares diagonally, both forward and backward. The same applies to the possibility of beating.

If a checker falls on the king's board during the process of beating, it immediately becomes a king and moves on as a king.

The winner of the game is the one who managed to beat all the checkers and kings of the opponent, or when the opponent cannot make a move 
(all the remaining checkers and kings of the opponent are blocked by the checkers of another player).

If no checker has been beaten within 40 moves, the game is considered a draw.

Players can agree to a draw earlier if they see no prospects of winning.
